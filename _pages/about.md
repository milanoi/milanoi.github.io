Hello! My name is  Sonia Milanoi. You can refer to me  by either, however I do prefer Milanoi.

I’m a systems thinker and behavioral science enthusiast with a great passion for data and design. I love to study user behavior, focusing on the finer details of product experiences and offerings. I thrive in inquiry by analysis and experimentation where I can find critical insights using statistical methods as mediums for research. I’m motivated by deconstructing complex and loosely defined problems into story-driven and user-centered solutions. I'm currently interested in working on social impact problems in developing markets, however, I am open to working on interesting and challenging business problems.

Through the years, I have amassed strong skill sets in **Data Modelling** (R, SQL, Python), **Data Visualization** (Tableau) and **Data Science** (Supervised/Unsupervised ML algorithms in R & Python).

Additionally, I have experience with design thinking as a complement to analytical methods and research study design & in prototyping solutions.

I am currently living in Nairobi, Kenya and operating on CAT/EAT time zones. Able to work perfectly with most Asian and all European time zones and can work with a 2 hour overlap with Far East and Americas time zones.

Cheers,  
Sonia Milanoi
